    High-Value Transactions:
    ${JSON.stringify(transactions, null, 2)}

    Staking Activity:
    ${JSON.stringify(stakingData, null, 2)}

    Additional Context:
    - **Celestia Overview:** Celestia is a modular data availability network that securely scales with the number of users, making it easy for anyone to launch their own blockchain.
    - **Staking Growth:** In 2024, Celestia experienced a 49.5% increase in total TIA staked, rising from 470 million to 703 million TIA, achieving one of the highest staking ratios among all Cosmos chains.
    - **Data Availability Sampling:** Celestia utilizes data availability sampling, where nodes verify a random sample of transactions instead of the entire blockchain history, leading to faster transaction speeds.
    - **Recent Price Movement:** Celestia's token, TIA, recently posted an 18% gain, trading at $3.77, attracting investor attention.

    Provide an analysis of market trends based on the transactions provided and showcase any potential investment opportunities based on the above information if any exist.

    Make sure to include the following in the report:
    - Market trends and sentiment to sustain your assessment
    - Potential investment opportunities within the Celestia ecosystem, especially based on the transactions reviewed
    - Risks and challenges that may impact the TIA token price
    - Insights for investors based on the transactions reviewed - i.e. what are some top movers in the Celestia ecosystem that they should look at? What are whales investing in?

    Please replace bullet points with emojis accurate to that meaning. Each sentence sustaining the reasoning should being with an appropriate emoji in the report more engaging and bring in as many diverse data points as you possibly can.

    The report should be in markdown format and should analyze market data trends to understand the market sentiment and potential investment opportunities for the TIA token. It should be concise and to the point and clearly formatted. The title of the insights should be an h2 markdown of the assessment of TIA.
    For example a title could be: "Analysis: Roll-ups are the future of Celestia" or "Analysis: Increase in activity from DeFi automated services in the last 24 hours"

    Especially when using a specific data point from the transactions fetched, it should share the hash and link of the transaction it used to make that recommendation as evidence.

    Here is an example of a well-written report:
    ## Market sentiment: positive
